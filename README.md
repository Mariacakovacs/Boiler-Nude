Are you always looking to follow a straighforward tutorial with files and everything you need to get started with Gulp and let's say a complete workflow? I've been there too! Unfortunately when I was a real beginner I never found one simple tutorial to follow, so here I am doing the job for you!

# My Goals#

* Install everything necessary to get Gulp up and running in a glance
* Compile multiple Sass files into one CSS file  
* Apply vendor prefixes 
* Minify
* Use Browsersync to live reload your page as you code across devices (Xcode Simulator too)
* Get the first scss files to get started with simple mixins, variables, fonts.
* Build a fully styled HTML documentUse sassdoc (gulp integration)
* Create a cheatsheet with all relevant commands lines 
* Create Git repo and version control the project

# You will need#

* Basic knowledge of CSS, JS, HTML
* Patience 
* A bottle of wine and/or a few beers 


# Disclamer #

I try my best to document everything incl troubleshooting, if does not work for you , please open an issue , don't blame me and don't be mean instead help me to find typos, errors or collaborate by giving me feedback.
