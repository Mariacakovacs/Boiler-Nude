# Boiler-Nude#

Are you always looking to follow a straighforward tutorial with files and everything you need to get started with Gulp and let's say a complete workflow? I've been there too! Unfortunately when I was a real beginner I never found one simple tutorial to follow, so here I am doing the job for you! 

With Boiler-Nude your are setting Up a Complete Gulp Workflow, getting started with the basic and important features of sass 
building a fully styled and beautiful HTML document using sassdoc Gulp integration, learning the basics of Git on the go and controlling all the process with your new best friend the terminal!
All you need to do is clone the repo , head to the wiki for the step by step guide and start working. 

# My Goals#

* Install everything necessary to get Gulp up and running in a glance
* Compile multiple Sass files into one CSS file  
* Apply vendor prefixes 
* Minify
* Use Browsersync to live reload your page as you code across devices (Xcode Simulator too)
* Get the first scss files to get started with simple mixins, variables, fonts.
* Build a fully styled HTML document using sassdoc (gulp integration)
* Create a cheatsheet with all relevant commands lines 
* Create Git repo and version control the project

# You will need#

* Basic knowledge of CSS, JS, HTML
* Patience 
* A bottle of wine and/or a few beers
